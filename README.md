# Handwritten Recognition with Raspberry Pi

The idea of this project was to create a virtual pen and apply a handwritten recognition model in the backend to recognize handwritten digits from a Raspberry Pi camera.

I have adapted the code created by the amazin people at LearnOpenCV: [Create a Virtual Pen And Eraser with OpenCV](https://www.learnopencv.com/creating-a-virtual-pen-and-eraser-with-opencv/) to predict the written images.
