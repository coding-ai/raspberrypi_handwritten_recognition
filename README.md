# Handwritten Recognition with Raspberry Pi

The idea of this project was to create a virtual pen and apply a handwritten recognition model in the backend to recognize handwritten digits from a Raspberry Pi camera.

I have adapted the code created by the amazin people at LearnOpenCV: [Create a Virtual Pen And Eraser with OpenCV](https://www.learnopencv.com/creating-a-virtual-pen-and-eraser-with-opencv/) to predict the written images. 


## Requirements

Run `conda env create` to create the virtual environment with the requirements from `requirements.txt`.

## Steps

Following the steps from the mentioned tutorial, run the following lines:

`python step1.py` - remember to press the 's' key to save your color range image.

`python step2.py`

`python step3.py` and now you can play and predict!

## Suggestions

Please open an issue if you have ideas on how to improve this! Have fun!
